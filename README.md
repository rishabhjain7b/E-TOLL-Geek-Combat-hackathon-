# E-TOLL-Geek-Combat-hackathon-
This project was done in geek combat hackathon using NodeMCU.

Arduino IDE was used to operate on the platform called Node MCU.
This project was done in a team of 5 and focussed on the followings:
1. Managing traffic at toll booths and making it easy for public to pay toll tax using RFID cards.
2. Managing traffic lights and the people who tend to break the law. 
   This system was designed to help out Government in handling the people who does not follow traffic rules and tries to violate it.
   
   The RFID tags were planted beneath the car's forward bumper and the reading coils were kept under the speedbreakers. 
   The complete system was connected to a NodeMCU module which has a WiFi module on board. The tag number was sent to server.
   This RFID number was fetched from the server using a python script which was working as a backend for this complete system.
   Further, this number was compared with the database available and the respective action was executed  which was also done using python.
   
   There was also an android app provided to every user for dynamically monitoring the challans that may have occured while barging into traffic signals.
